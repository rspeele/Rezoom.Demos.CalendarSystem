# CalendarSystem.Model.SystemTasks

This assembly defines types relevant to tasks handled in the background by the system, like sending emails.

It has to reference the other model assemblies to refer to types defined in them, but consumers shouldn't have
to necessarily reference assemblies other than the ones for the task type they care about.
