# CalendarSystem.Product.MVCWebApplication

Just a quick demo of how you can use the domain layer in a real application.

In this case I used ASP.NET MVC just because I'm familiar with it. I didn't provide a product UI for any functions of
the system other than login yet, but hopefully the general idea comes across.
